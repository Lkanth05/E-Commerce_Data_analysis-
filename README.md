  - Sessions with Views: 59,169 (75.3%)
  - Sessions with Cart: 14,396 (18.3%)
  - Sessions with Purchase: 9,588 (12.2%)
- **Conversion Rates**:
  - View to Cart: 24.3%
  - Cart to Purchase: 66.6%
  - Overall View to Purchase: 16.2%

### 4. Revenue Analysis
- **Total Revenue**: $4,711,229.40
- **Total Orders**: 9,829
- **Average Order Value**: $479.32
- **Top Revenue Categories**: Electronics (Tablets, Laptops, Smartphones)

### 5. Machine Learning Models

#### Purchase Prediction Model
- **Algorithms**: Random Forest, Logistic Regression
- **Features**: total_events, view_count, cart_count, sessions, avg_price, max_price, price_std, categories_viewed, branded_events
- **Performance**:
  - Random Forest: 80.0% test accuracy
  - Logistic Regression: 84.6% test accuracy
- **Key Predictors**: View count, average price, price variability

#### Feature Importance Rankings
1. View Count (17.2%)
2. Average Price (14.2%)
3. Price Standard Deviation (14.2%)
4. Maximum Price (13.9%)
5. Total Events (11.1%)

### 6. Customer Segmentation
- **Method**: K-Means Clustering (K=4)
- **Segments Identified**:
  - **Active Shoppers** (60.3%): High engagement, 69.5% purchase rate
  - **Casual Users** (39.7%): Lower engagement, 55.4% purchase rate

#### RFM Analysis by Segment
- **Active Shoppers**: Recent activity (11-15 days), high frequency (10-14 events), moderate monetary value ($485-618)
- **Casual Users**: Less recent activity (23 days), low frequency (7 events), lower monetary value ($231-514)

### 7. Data Visualizations
- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: Multi-panel visualization showing key metrics
- **Chart Types**: Bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, funnel visualization
- **Business Intelligence**: Executive-ready visualizations for decision making

### 8. Interactive Web Application
- **Technology**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Chart.js
- **Sections**: Overview, Conversion Analysis, Customer Segmentation, ML Insights
- **Features**: Interactive navigation, responsive design, professional styling

## Business Recommendations

### For Active Shoppers
- Implement cart abandonment campaigns
- Offer limited-time discounts to boost conversion
- Focus on cross-sell and upsell opportunities
- Develop loyalty programs for retention

### For Casual Users
- Launch re-engagement campaigns with special offers
- Simplify the purchase process
- Gather feedback on barriers to purchase
- Provide educational content about products

### Overall Strategy
- **Peak Hours**: Focus marketing efforts during 7 AM, 11 AM, and 6-9 PM
- **High-Value Categories**: Prioritize electronics and appliances inventory
- **Conversion Optimization**: Improve cart-to-purchase conversion (currently 66.6%)
- **User Experience**: Address the 24% drop-off from view to cart

## Technical Implementation

### Tools and Libraries Used
- **Data Analysis**: Python, Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Chart.js
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Means)
- **Web Development**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Statistical Analysis**: Conversion funnel analysis, RFM modeling

### Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Preparation**: Dataset creation and cleaning
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: Statistical analysis and pattern identification
3. **Feature Engineering**: User-level aggregations and behavioral metrics
4. **Model Development**: Predictive modeling and clustering
5. **Evaluation & Interpretation**: Model performance assessment
6. **Visualization & Reporting**: Dashboard creation and insights presentation
7. **Deployment**: Interactive web application development

## Key Insights and Findings

### Customer Behavior Patterns
- **High View-to-Cart Drop-off**: 75% opportunity for optimization
- **Strong Cart-to-Purchase Conversion**: 67% indicates effective checkout process
- **Category Preferences**: Electronics dominates revenue despite lower order volume
- **Temporal Patterns**: Consistent activity throughout week, peak hours identified

### Predictive Modeling Results
